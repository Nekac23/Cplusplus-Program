# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project I chose was my investment app. I had to create a code that helped the user figure out if they invested so much money into a interest yield account that at a certain % their initial deposit could grow. And it gives the amount of the deposit with the added interest for over a 12 month period.

What did you do particularly well?
I honestly I felt like my whole code was done pretty well! I worked hard and it was a challenging trying to remember loops and figuring out the right code to implement.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I  could have added more features or options to be code to give the user more in depth look at their account.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Writing a function to calculate bank balances with and without a monthly deposit! I had to go back in my zybook lessons and reread and try to understand how to write this function! Alaos I used Youtube and the feedback tool Sense to help me. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
With this project I feel it touched base on the basics of coding and c++. Knowing how to create functions and methods and loops and more.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I just took what I learned and researched and tried my best to implement everything I know and learned. It was a struggle with this project, I will not lie.
